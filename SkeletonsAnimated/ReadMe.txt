	On the about page:
		in the dark box to the right of the pointing skeleton, or above if mobile, a button wiggles to get the users attention, with a little altering this could do all kinds of transfroms

Description:   Continue to modify and expand your enterprise website.  In particular, start enforcing good design practice in separating structure (HTML) from style (CSS),

1.	 If you have not already done so, restructure your
home page to extract out the style into a distinct CSS file.  
Ideally, this CSS file should become the “style file” for your entire site.

2.	Include both a header (nominally with banner and navbar) 
and a footer for your website.  These items must be common to every page.  
You must be able to transit between any two pages on your site via the navbar.

3.	Create a separate “Informational” page for your enterprise,
accessible from the navigation bar.  For example, this page 
could contain information about:
•	Products and services offered by your enterprise 
		(note:  this should be a separate page from inventory, 
		which will be done in a subsequent project).
•	The various staff personnel at your enterprise
•	The organizational components of your vast, corporate empire

Note that you only need choose one theme for your informational page.
Whatever information is displayed should be separable into categories
for the next assignment.  For example, personnel can be separated 
into different categories:  management, staff, service, sales, etc.  

This file should likewise use the styles defined in your site CSS file.  
There should be a minimum of 15 items on the page.  Be sure to use 
photos to illustrate what is being listed.  

Submission:  Keep all project materials in a hierarchical directory structure.  Create a zip file for the root directory (containing all subdirectories) and upload to D2L.  

Caveats:  
•	Strive for consistency and elegance in your web site, across all pages. You should use the same CSS file for the site.  Each page should have the same header (banner), navbar, and footer.  
•	You must use at least one dynamic CSS effect on each page.  The lecture on CSS has a number of examples of dynamic CSS effects and more can be found online.  Please use a README file to communicate what these are.  Note that navbar dynamic CSS only counts once.
•	You will be graded on your creativity in using CSS and the quality of your website.
